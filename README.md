## R Environment

1. BinarySearch(x, list): In the R environment, there is another package has the similar functionality called, [findintervals](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/pracma/versions/1.9.9/topics/findintervals). This function contains two inputs: a numeric value `x` and a numeric vector `xs`, and it finds the indices `i` in `xs` such that either x=xs[i] or `xs[i] or xs[i]>x>xs[i+1]`. However, the `findintervals` function is restricted to numeric vectors. The BinarySearch function is able to handle both numeric and character vectors.
